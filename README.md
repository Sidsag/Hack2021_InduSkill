Hack 2021(to create solutions that can make a difference)

Due to Covid ,millions of workers in India have had to migrate from their work. However, now, when the country goes into an unlock phase, itâ€™s a challenge for industries to find skilled workers for their industry as well as for workers having basic labour skills like sewing/welding/mechanics etc. Taking the current situation in mind, we have hundreds of websites available where educated people can apply but for the workers having skills like this, they have only one way to go: to middle man(agent) who takes hefty commisions from them. Also, industries have to charge those people to get some workers.

Induskill as solution for above: We propose to build a website Induskill( industry & skill) As follows: Induskill is a platform to provide help and support to skilled workers to find suitable industries with their preferred location and salary. Additionally, we provide assistance to industries to find workers with appropriate skillsets. Our aim is to provide a conection between industries and skilled workers. We also invite NGOs and government organisations to collaborate with us in our mission
